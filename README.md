# Hash Table

This program is capable of reading a file with bid information and sorting the contents by using a hash table.  The user can tell the program to load the bid information, display the bid information, find a specified bid by ID, and remove a specified bid by ID.  Currently, the specified bid in question is a preset value, but the program could be adjusted to allow for custom input.
